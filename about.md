At Groundworks, we have developed Story Lab to help individuals author the story they want to live as missional people. We work to help people discover how to create a vocation that is less about what they do, and more about who they are. Story Lab is a facilitated weekend event to help inspire mission as a lifestyle. We believe that a vocation should be about creating a life - not just about earning a living. Living with great intentionality creates vision. This workshop helps its participants begin to live their story and author their personal mission.
