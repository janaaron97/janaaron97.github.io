## Our work

### The Grove
At Groundworks, we have a history of supporting entrepreneurs by providing them with access to quality workspace, coaching and mentoring, a shared knowledge network, peer-to-peer training, and a collaborative ecology. Our collaborative workspaces, known as the Grove, have the potential to launch initiatives that will benefit communities and cities and will drive economic development.


### Story Lab
Story Lab is a facilitated weekend event to help you author the story you want to live. At Story Lab, we help you discover how to create a vocation that is less about what you do, and more about who you are. Our vocation should be about creating a life - not just earning a living. Living with great intentionality creates vision. This workshop will help you begin to live your story and author your personal mission.
